# Work with LimboAI
[limboai][limboai] is an open-source C++ plugin for Godot Engine 4 providing a combination of Behavior Trees and State Machines, which can be used together to create complex AI behaviors. It comes with a behavior tree editor, built-in documentation, visual debugger, extensive demo project with a tutorial, and more! While it is implemented in C++, it fully supports GDScript for creating your own tasks and states.

In this example, we will show how to use LimboAI with the Godot Agent plugin. 
The LLM will be used to make decisions based on the agent's memory and the current state of the game. The agent will use the LLM to generate actions based on its memory and the current state of the game. This integration allows for dynamic and responsive AI behavior that adapts to the game's context.
