# Work with Dialogic2

[dialogic2][dialogic2] is a powerful open-source dialogue system for Godot Engine 4. It allows you to create complex branching dialogues, cutscenes, and interactive storytelling experiences. Dialogic2 provides a user-friendly interface for designing dialogues, managing character assets, and integrating with your game logic.

In this example, we will show how to use Dialogic2 with the Godot Agent plugin. The LLM will be used to generate dynamic dialogue options based on the player's choices and the current state of the game. This integration allows for more engaging and responsive storytelling experiences.
